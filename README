SilverBall

This is a simple game demo for Android (4+). Move the ball into the hole.

The game uses a TextureView and the accelerometer.

Simplified and refactored version (without obstacles causing collisions)

This version also shows how to use Shaders and certain tricks to create fancy TextViews (see screenshot in misc folder).

Explained in my german book "Spieleprogrammierung mit Android Studio", chapter 5:
